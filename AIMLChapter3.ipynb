    "### Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning used to train models from labeled training data.  It allows you to \n",
    "### predict the output for future or unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Labelled Data: Data that is labelled. Group of features that is tagged with labels. \n",
    "### Training data is the data on which Machine discovers patterns so that input parameters correspond to target. \n",
    "### Machine Leanring Model: The training yields an ML model that you can use to make prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Supervised Learning: \n",
    "####   1. Weather Forecast: Based on weather data collected, machine can train as all data is labelled data such as temprature, humidity, air pressure, etc. \n",
    "####   2. Gmail filter: Based on sender's email address, IP address, email content, user's past behavior, the gmail spam filter can flag email as spam or not spam. Further data collected such as reaction from email receiver such as if user has not opened an email or delete immediately or marked as spam. \n",

    "#### Supervised Learning Real-Life Scenarios\n",

    "###  Understanding the Algorithm\n",
    "#### Training data consists of inputs, also known as features, and output, also known as label. \n",

    "#### Supervised Learning Flow includes two phases\n",
    "####   1. Training and Testing: Includes historical data where the total population is randomly distributed between   different samples and a sample is chosen randomly for training and a sample is chosen randomly for testing. Training dataset is then used for machine learning to use statistical modeling for prediction.  Test dataset is then used to validate to come up the Model Validation Outcome. For example, 70% of dataset is randomly distributed for training and 30% of dataset is randomly distributed for testing.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now you have tested the data then you want to use new data for prediction.  You apply statistical modeling to the learned algorithm y = f(X) to predict production data.  You will get the Prediciton Outcome \n",

    "####        (i)   Classification is a supervised learning where the output has predefined labels that have discrete values. \n",
    "####        (ii)  A discrete value is a value that is obtained by counting.  \n",

    "#### 1. Linear Regression: A statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables denoted by x and y respectively. You examine the two factors (a) The result falls between -1 and 1. 0 means no correlation, 1 means positive correlation, and -1 means negative correlation. (b) Prediction: When the relationship between x and y is known, use this to predict future values of y for a value of X.  This is done by fitting a regression line and is represented by linear equation y = a*X + b. Variable that you are predicting is called \"Criterion\" variable and variables that you are basing your prediction are called \"Predictor\"\n",

    "#### 2. Multiple Linear Regression: Explains the relationship between two or more independent variables that are x1, x2, x3,...etc. and one continuous variable that is y. The euqation is y = m1*X1 + m2*X2 + m3*X3 +....+ mn*Xn + c.  Here y is dependent variable, m1, m2, m3...mn are slope and, c is coefficient\n",
